## My process

I have developed using a Mobile First approach. I worked from top to bottom and added the background as latest. My last steps was making minor tweaks here and there for responsiveness.

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
